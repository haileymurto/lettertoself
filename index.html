        <p>Dear <span class=name></span>,
        <br>
        <br>
        Hope you are well.
        <br>

        This is me writing to you; I am now 44, and you are 21. There are so many things I would like to say to you. But I don't want to lecture you because I know how much you hate that, but you know me, I'll say what I have to say. I am actually a lot more vocal than I used to be, and believe me, it's so much better. There is no use in keeping things in your heart and sulking over them. The best thing to do is to say it.
        <br>
        <br>
        Sincerely,
        <br>
        <span class=name></span>
